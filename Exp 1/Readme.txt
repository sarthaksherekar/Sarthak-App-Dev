#This is the simple experiment to preform CRUD on an array using JavaScript

This experiment shows how to perform basic operations on a list of items in JavaScript. 
The four main actions are:
- Adding a new item (Create)
- Showing the items (Read)
- Changing an item (Update)
- Removing an item (Delete)

These actions together are called CRUD operations and they help in managing data easily.
